# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System is a Java-based application that automates book issuing, returns, and member management. It uses a console interface and object-oriented design, categorizing books by genre. Though limited to in-memory storage, itâ€™s ideal for small libraries or academic use, providing a strong foundation for future enhancements.
